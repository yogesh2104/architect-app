# Architect App - UX & Retention Upgrade Guide (v2)

## 1) Core Philosophy Shift

### Old Approach:

System-first (features, CRUD, admin power)

### New Approach:

**Experience-first (engagement, interaction, retention)**

Goal:

* Increase session time
* Increase return users
* Improve conversion (inquiry → quotation)

---

## 2) Landing Page Transformation (P0)

### Problem:

* Feels like template
* Weak emotional hook
* Product-first instead of value-first

### Solution:

#### 2.1 Hero Section (CRITICAL)

Replace product-focused messaging with outcome-driven messaging:

Examples:

* “Design Your Dream Interior in Minutes”
* “Get Instant Architecture Quote + Design Ideas”

Add:

* Strong CTA
* Visual hierarchy
* Subtle animation
* Overlay gradients

---

#### 2.2 Instant Value Feature (HIGH IMPACT)

Add:

### “Instant Quote Preview”

Flow:

1. Select:

This becomes the **main hook for user retention**.
